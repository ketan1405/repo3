              It all started with A Kids Book About Racism,
              a book written by co-founder and CEO, Jelani Memory.
              As a black father with a blended family (4 white kids and two brown kids), racism was an inevitable topic of conversation. 
              He thought he’d only print one copy, but it turned out other grownups thought their kids could use an honest kids book on the topic. 
              That one book turned into more by new authors on topics like belonging, feminism, gratitude, cancer, and so many more. 
              Meet A Kids Book About, a new kind of publishing company that makes kids books that matter, because kids are ready.
